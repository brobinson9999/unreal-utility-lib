Dependencies
  It is possible to build the unreal-utility-lib package using conventional means, in which case no additional dependencies are required. The optional build scripts have a dependency on pyun-build, avaiable on Github at:
  http://github.com/brobinson9999/pyun-build

Building
  These utilities can be built for either UT2004 or UT3. To build for UT2004 the code from the src and src-ut2004 subdirectories should be used. To build for UT3 the code from src and src-ut3 should be used.

Using the Build Scripts
  The build scripts use pyun-build. It should be in the same directory or on your PYTHONPATH. You will need to set your UT3PATH or UT2004PATH environment variable, or you can alter the build scripts to specify a path directly.
